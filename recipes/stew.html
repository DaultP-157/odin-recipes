    <p>This Stew pot takes no time to prep. I usually prepare the ingredients the night before and in 
        the morning before going to work, I throw everything in the slow cooker. Then everything is ready 
        when we come back home from work with the kids.</p>

    <p>Pare this meal with a good red wine and a toasty bagette to dip in the bole of stew. You will not
        regret trying this recipe, trust me!</p>
